**Title: Vegetable Classification Model with TensorFlow**

* **finaltrain.ipynb**:
dataset loading, preprocessing, EDA, model construction, and evaluation.
Incorporates image enhancement techniques, data visualization, and fine-tuning of the InceptionV3
model. Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for efficient deep learning implementation.

* **finaltestVegDetect.ipynb**:
Loads a pre-trained InceptionV3 model and applies image preprocessing,
including color and contrast enhancement. Showcases the model's adaptability to different input
conditions.
